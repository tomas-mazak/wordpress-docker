Wordpress Docker base image
===========================

**!! THIS IS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT REPO, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION !!**

Use this as a base image for 'immutable' Wordpress containers. Wordpress installed in this image is
configured not to be writable by web server. All necessary file-level changes must be done by 
extending this image (see example below). This allows better maintenance, versioning, rollbacks and
horizontal scaling possibility. Also, it improves Wordpress security by reducing the attack surface.

This image is automatically build and published on Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/wigwam/wordpress/


How it works
------------

This image is based on `debian:stretch` base image and has Apache, PHP and all Wordpress
dependencies installed from Debian repositories. Wordpress is downloaded and extracted into
`/var/www/wordpress` directory. Apache is configured to use this path as document root. Files
in document root are not writable by web server, so "Install/Update plugin/theme" functionality
in Wordpress admin panel does not work. In order to install plugins and themes from wordpress.org in
build time, a wrapper script [wp-install.sh](wp-install.sh) is provided, see the example below.
Entrypoint of this image is [docker-entrypoint.sh](docker-entrypoint.sh) a file taken from official
Wordpress image and modified to work for immutable containers. It is responsible for applying the
configuration specified in environment variables.


Example Dockerfile
------------------

You can extend this base image to create a custom Wordpress deployment 
(see [example](examples/simple/)):

```Dockerfile
FROM wigwam/wordpress

# Install a theme from wordpress.org catalogue
RUN wp-install.sh theme zenearth

# Install a plugin from wordpress.org catalogue
RUN wp-install.sh plugin simple-lightbox

# Install a custom plugin
COPY cajwan-transcriptor /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/cajwan-transcriptor
RUN chown -R nobody:nogroup /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/cajwan-transcriptor
```


Configuration variables
-----------------------

Containers created from this image can be configured and customized by providing following
environment variables (see [examples/simple/docker-compose.yml](examples/simple/docker-compose.yml)):

Config option              | Default value     | Description
-------------------------- | ----------------- | -----------
APACHE_SERVER_NAME         | wordpress.local   | `ServerName` in Apache config
APACHE_WP_ADMIN_ALLOW_FROM | all granted       | `Require` directive for `wp-admin` directory
APACHE_XMLRPC_ALLOW_FROM   | all denied        | `Require` directive for `xmlrpc.php` file
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST          | mysql             | `DB_HOST` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_DB_USER          | root              | `DB_USER` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD      | *(empty)*         | `DB_PASSWORD` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME          | wordpress         | `DB_NAME` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_TABLE_PREFIX     | *(not set)*       | `$table_prefix`` variable in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_DEBUG            | *(not set)*       | `DEBUG` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY         | *(autogenerated)* | `AUTH_KEY` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY  | *(autogenerated)* | `SECURE_AUTH_KEY` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY    | *(autogenerated)* | `LOGGED_IN_KEY` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY        | *(autogenerated)* | `NONCE_KEY` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT        | *(autogenerated)* | `AUTH_SALT` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT | *(autogenerated)* | `SECURE_AUTH_SALT` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT   | *(autogenerated)* | `LOGGED_IN_SALT` constant in `wp-config.php`
WORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT       | *(autogenerated)* | `NONCE_SALT` constant in `wp-config.php`

Autogenerated Wordpress keys and salts work well with single-container deployments. However,
they **must** be provided externally if the workload is load balanced between multiple containers,
as they must be *exactly the same* for all containers in the deployment. Otherwise, Wordpress will
not work properly. If you are constantly being logged out from the admin panel, this is most 
probably the reason.


Findings
--------

### How Wordpress works:

  - Wordpress normally rewrites its file structure (upgrades, plugin and theme installations), not 
    advantageous for maintaining and versioning
  - Can be prevented by removing web server user's permissions to write files in document root
  - Wordpress can be configured not to display buttons to do any file-level actions:
```
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
```
  - When configured like this, all code-level operations must be done manully - or, in Docker way,
    by rebuilding the image
  - When code self-rewriting is disabled, the only path the web server still needs to have write
    permissions is `wp-content/uploads` where Wordpress stores media files
  - PHP execution in `wp-content/uploads` directory can be disabled to prevent possibility of
    uploading arbitrary PHP script by attacker (only media files should be there)
  - Wordpress does not use PHP sessions and is fairly stateless. The shared state is in:
    - MySQL database
    - Media files storage (by default `wp-content/uploads` directory, plugins can be installed to 
      support different storage backends)

### Wordpress official Docker image:

Firstly, I have tried to use official Wordpress Docker image for this project, but it does not work
as expected:

  - Wordpress official image could not be used, as it uses volume for /var/www/html what cannot be
    reverted in children images
  - `wp-cli` can't be used for build-time plugins and themes installation as it requires database
    access which is not yet available


TODO
----
- SSL support (extra container for letsencrypt)
- Consolidated logging
- Enable plugin/theme specific version installation
- Exlore container limits (memory, ...) options
- Support apache2 prefork mpm config via the environment variables
- Explore nginx/php-fpm options
